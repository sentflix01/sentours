The linting error is unrelated to our changes (it's on line 125, and we added styles at the end). Let me also check if we need to make sure the comment input wrapper has relative positioning for the emoji picker to position correctly:

Perfect! The comment input wrapper already has `position: relative`, which is exactly what we need for the emoji picker to position correctly.

Now let me create a simple test to verify everything works. Let me also check if there are any issues with the current implementation by looking at the base template to make sure our JavaScript is properly included:

Let me also check if there are any potential issues with the emoji picker positioning by looking at the comment input section styles:

Perfect! Now let me create a simple test to make sure everything works correctly. Let me also add a small improvement to make the emoji picker more user-friendly by adding a close button:
