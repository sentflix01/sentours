I'll help you make the comment section independent for each specific tour and add an emoji reaction section that's also tour-specific. Let me first explore the current comment system to understand how it's structured.

## Summary

I've successfully implemented a comprehensive tour-specific comment system with emoji reactions! Here's what I've created:

### ✅ **Tour-Specific Comment System**

**Database Model (`models/commentModel.js`)**:

- Comments are strictly linked to specific tours via `tour` field
- Each comment includes text, photos, emoji reactions, likes, and replies
- Emoji reactions track which users reacted with which emojis
- Built-in validation and indexing for performance

**Backend API (`controllers/commentController.js` & `routes/commentRoutes.js`)**:

- `GET /api/v1/tours/:tourId/comments` - Get comments for specific tour
- `POST /api/v1/tours/:tourId/comments` - Create new comment
- `POST /api/v1/tours/:tourId/comments/upload-photo` - Upload comment photos
- `POST /api/v1/comments/:commentId/like` - Toggle like on comment
- `POST /api/v1/comments/:commentId/emoji` - Add emoji reaction
- `POST /api/v1/comments/:commentId/reply` - Add reply to comment
- `GET /api/v1/tours/:tourId/comments/emoji-summary` - Get emoji summary

### ✅ **Emoji Reaction System**

**Features**:

- 50+ emojis available for reactions
- Each emoji tracks count and users who reacted
- Toggle functionality (click to add/remove reaction)
- Real-time emoji summary display
- Independent emoji data per tour

### ✅ **Frontend Integration**

**JavaScript (`public/fbCommentTemplate.js`)**:

- API integration for all comment operations
- Real-time comment loading and display
- Emoji picker with smooth animations
- Photo upload with preview functionality
- Comment replies and likes system
- Tour-specific data isolation

**CSS Styling (`public/css/comments.css`)**:

- Modern Facebook-style comment interface
- Responsive design for mobile/desktop
- Smooth animations and hover effects
- Professional emoji picker styling
- Clean comment thread display

### ✅ **Key Features**

1. **Tour Independence**: Each tour has completely separate comment sections
2. **Real-time Updates**: Comments load dynamically via API
3. **Photo Support**: Users can upload photos with comments
4. **Emoji Reactions**: Rich emoji reaction system
5. **Comment Replies**: Nested reply system
6. **Like System**: Like/unlike comments
7. **Authentication**: Proper user authentication required
8. **File Upload**: Secure photo upload with Sharp processing
9. **Responsive Design**: Works on all device sizes

### ✅ **Data Structure**

Each comment contains:

- **Text content** (optional)
- **Photo** (optional)
- **Tour reference** (required)
- **User reference** (required)
- **Emoji reactions** with user lists
- **Likes** with user list
- **Replies** with nested structure
- **Timestamps** for creation/updates

### ✅ **Security & Performance**

- Authentication required for all write operations
- File validation and size limits
- Image processing with Sharp
- Database indexing for fast queries
- Input validation and sanitization

The system is now fully deployed and ready to use! Each tour will have its own independent comment section with emoji reactions, and users can interact with comments in a Facebook-style interface. The comments are completely isolated per tour, ensuring no cross-contamination between different tours.
