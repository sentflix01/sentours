I can see the issues you're pointing out! Let me fix both problems:

1. **Move emoji and photo icons inside the comment input field**
2. **Make emoji picker containers independent for each tour instead of global**

Let me update the overview template and JavaScript to fix these issues:

Perfect! I've successfully fixed both issues you mentioned:

## ✅ **Fixed Issues**

### 1. **Moved Icons Inside Comment Input Field**

- **Before**: Emoji and photo icons were outside the comment input field
- **After**: Icons are now inside the input field using a new `.comment-input-icons` container
- **Layout**: The input field now has a rounded background with icons positioned on the right side inside the field
- **Styling**: Added proper CSS for the new layout with focus states and hover effects

### 2. **Made Emoji Pickers Tour-Specific**

- **Before**: One global emoji picker that appeared outside tour boundaries
- **After**: Each tour now has its own independent emoji picker container
- **Positioning**: Emoji pickers are now positioned relative to each tour's comment section
- **Independence**: Each tour's emoji picker is completely separate and doesn't interfere with others

## ✅ **Key Changes Made**

### **Template Updates (`views/overview.pug`)**:

- Changed `.comment-actions` to `.comment-input-icons`
- Moved icons inside the `.comment-input-wrapper`
- Each tour now has its own emoji picker container: `emoji-picker-container-${tour.id}`

### **CSS Updates (`public/css/comments.css`)**:

- Added `.comment-input-wrapper` styling with rounded background
- Created `.comment-input-icons` container for proper icon positioning
- Updated `.comment-action-btn` styling for better visual integration
- Modified `.emoji-picker-container` positioning to be relative to each tour

### **JavaScript Updates (`public/fbCommentTemplate.js`)**:

- Updated emoji picker positioning logic
- Made emoji pickers independent per tour
- Improved click outside handling for tour-specific pickers

## ✅ **Visual Improvements**

1. **Better UX**: Icons are now logically placed inside the input field where users expect them
2. **Cleaner Design**: The input field has a unified appearance with integrated icons
3. **Tour Independence**: Each tour's emoji picker stays within its own boundaries
4. **Responsive**: The layout works well on both desktop and mobile devices

The comment system now has a much more polished and intuitive interface, with emoji and photo icons properly integrated into the input field, and each tour having its own independent emoji picker that doesn't interfere with other tours on the page!
