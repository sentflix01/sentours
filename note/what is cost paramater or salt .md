Great question! The **cost parameter** (also known as **salt rounds**) and **salt** are key parts of making password hashing secure. Let’s break them down simply:

---

## 🔐 What Is a Salt?

A **salt** is a random string that is **added to a password before hashing**.

### 🧠 Why?

* To make sure that **even if two users have the same password**, they’ll have **different hashes**.
* It protects against precomputed attacks like **rainbow tables**.

### Example:

```js
const password = 'mypassword';

// Without salt: everyone with same password → same hash
// With salt: even if password is same → different hash
```

## ⚙️ What Is the Cost Parameter / Salt Rounds?

The **cost parameter** (or **salt rounds**) determines **how many times the hashing algorithm runs**.

> More rounds = More secure, but **slower** to compute.

### In `bcryptjs`, you define it like this:

```js
const bcrypt = require('bcryptjs');
const saltRounds = 12;

const hashed = await bcrypt.hash('mypassword', saltRounds);
```

* `12` is a good default: secure and still fast enough for most apps.
* `10–12` is common.
* Higher values like `14+` are more secure but slower.

---

## 🔁 Behind the Scenes

* `bcrypt.hash('mypassword', 12)`:

  * Generates a random **salt**
  * Combines it with the password
  * Hashes it **2¹² = 4096 times**
  * Result is a **hashed string that includes the salt**

## ✅ Summary

| Term               | Meaning                                                                |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Salt**           | Random string added to password before hashing                         |
| **Cost parameter** | Number of rounds to apply hashing (e.g. 12 = 4096 iterations)          |
| **Why important**  | Prevents attackers from using precomputed hashes or brute-force easily |
